# Co-op-Reports
University of Victoria engineering co-op reports 
This repository holds my two prior coop reports. 

My first work term was with Prime Engineering. I worked with the power systems team and was responible for building ECAD models and performing different types of power system analysis of the schematics. I was also responible for maintaining their database(an excel sheet). Althrough there a realatively small company a real database would have been extremely benefital and that why I choose to write my report on the different types of databases, so I would learning more about them and than impliment one for the power systems team.

My second work term was with Science Venture. I worked as a INSTEM instructor, which was an indigenous outreach program to work with surrounding indigenous students on reserves to teach STEM topics(Science, Techology, Engineering, Mathmatics). I would also go around to schools all around southern vancouver island, teaching all kinds of STEM topics, ranging sorting algorithms, cryptography, programming, robotics, and other general Science. I chose to write my report on active learning becuase education is something that I am very passionate and believe in.
